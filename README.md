# ⏱⏳ Project Estimation Formula

This Python script calculates the expected time to end a project and the deviation using a specific formula. The formula is derived from ["The Code Cleaner: Code of Conduct for Professional Programmers."](https://www.amazon.es/limpiador-código-programadores-profesionales-Especiales/dp/8441540845)

## Formula

The formula used in this script is as follows:
```
u = (O + 4N + P) / 6
d = (P - O) / 6
```

Where:
- O represents the optimistic estimation in days,
- N represents the normal estimation in days, and
- P represents the pessimistic estimation in days.

## The Code Cleaner: Code of Conduct for Professional Programmers

"The Code Cleaner: Code of Conduct for Professional Programmers" is a set of guidelines and best practices for professional programmers to ensure ethical and responsible behavior. It provides a framework for maintaining high standards in software development projects. The formula used in this script is inspired by "The Code Cleaner" and is designed to assist in project estimation.

## Usage
